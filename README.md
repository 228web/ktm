## Install

    python3 -m venv venv   # Python 2 should work as well, but we suggest to you to use virtualenv
    . venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

If you also want to get the factorization machines running, follow the [pywFM](https://github.com/jfloff/pywFM) (weird) suggestion:

    git clone https://github.com/srendle/libfm  # In the same ktm folder, it's better
    cd libfm
    git reset --hard 91f8504a15120ef6815d6e10cc7dee42eebaab0f
    make all

## Run

    make  # To get the encodings (npz)
    make  # To get results (txt)

You can also download the Assistments 2009 dataset in `data/assistments09` and get:

    make big

## Results

On the Assistments 2009 dataset:

| AUC time    | users + items  | skills + wins + fails | items + skills + wins + fails |
|:------------|:---------------|:----------------------|:------------------------------|
| LR          | 0.734 (IRT) 2s | 0.651 (PFA) 9s        | 0.737 23s                     |
| FM *d* = 20 | 0.730 2min9s   | 0.652 43s             | 0.739 2min30s                 |

Computation times are given for a i7 with 2.6 GHz, with 200 epochs of FM training.
